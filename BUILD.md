Building Iron Foundry .NET source
---------------------------------

* Prerequisites:
  * Visual Studio (2013 currently used for development)
  * .NET Framework 4.5

* Before running Visual Studio:
  * Run `build.bat`. It will restore NuGet packages and do a Release-x64 build, which will also create installers.

* You're all set!
